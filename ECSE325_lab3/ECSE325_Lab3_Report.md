# Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to learn how to implement digital filters using VHDL, and to verify the design by performing testbench simulations using ModelSim. In specific, a 25-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter was required to be implemented in this lab. An FIR filter is a filter whose response to any finite length input is of finite period. This filter is implemented by convolving the input signal with the digital filter's impulse response. For a causal filter of order $N$, each value of the output sequence is a weighted sum of the most recent input values:
$$
y(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} b_i \times x(n-i),
$$
where $x(n)$,  $y(n)$ and $b_i$ are the input signal, output signal, and weights, respectively. *Fig. 1* shows the direct form of an $N$-tap FIR filter.

# Code Implementation

We were given two files, ***lab3-In.txt*** and ***lab3-coef.txt***. ***lab3-In.txt*** contains 1000 floating-point numbers, which will be the inputs to the filter implemented in VHDL, and ***lab3-coef.txt*** contains the weights (or coefficients) in floating point representation. The first task was to write a program to convert these floating-point numbers to fixed-point and write them to two new files. Below is the the 'C' code we modified from lab 2 to implement this conversion.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

char *decimal_to_binary(int);

/*
 * This method reads the floating point values from to separate files,
 * convert them to fixed point, and stores them in two new files
 */
void main()
{
    // Open the files
    FILE *lab3_in = fopen("lab3-In.txt", "r");
    FILE *lab3_coef= fopen("lab3-coef.txt", "r");

    // Create arrarys to hold the x values and y values
    float inputs[1000];
    float coef[25];
    int i;

    // Read each floating point number from the files and store them in their corresponding array
    for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        fscanf(lab3_in, "%f", &inputs[i]);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 25; i++)
    {
        fscanf(lab3_coef, "%f", &coef[i]);
    }

    // Done with these files, close them
    fclose(lab3_in);
    fclose(lab3_coef);

    // Go through th arrary multiplying each number by 2^15 because 
    // b = a x 2^F where a = floating point number, F = fractional length
    for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        inputs[i] = inputs[i] * 32768;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 25; i++)
    {
        coef[i] = coef[i] * 32768;
    }

    // Open the files where the fixed point values will be written to
    FILE *lab3_in_fixed_point = fopen("lab3-in-fixed-point.txt", "w");
    FILE *lab3_coef_fixed_point = fopen("lab3-coef-fixed-point.txt", "w");

    int n;
    char *pointer;

    // iterate through each number, convert it to binary (2's complement) then print it to it's corresponding file
    for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        n = (int)inputs[i];
        pointer = decimal_to_binary(n);
        fprintf(lab3_in_fixed_point, "%s\n", pointer);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 25; i++)
    {
        n = (int)coef[i];
        pointer = decimal_to_binary(n);
        fprintf(lab3_coef_fixed_point, "%s\n", pointer);
    }

    // Free the pointer from memory and close the files because we are done with them
    free(pointer);
    fclose(lab3_in_fixed_point);
    fclose(lab3_coef_fixed_point);
}

/*
 * This method take an integer as an argument an converts it to a 16-bit binary number
 * If the integer is negative, the number gets convert to its positive binary value,
 * then gets converted again to 2's complement
 * returns a pointer to the MSB of the binary number in memory
 */

    // the argument n was positive, convert to 2's complement
    {
        // Starting from the LSB, iterate through the array backwards until the first '1' bit is reached
        // All the numbers before (and not including) this 1 value need to be inverted
        for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            if (binary_digits[i] == 1)
            {
                invert_spot = i;
                break;
            }
        }
         // Starting at the MSB, iterate throught the arrary storing the inverted value in memory starting at the pointer
        for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)
        {
            if (i < invert_spot)
            {
                if (binary_digits[i] == 0)
                {
                    *(pointer + i) = 1 + '0';
                }
                else
                {
                    *(pointer + i) = 0 + '0';
                }
            }
            else
            // Once the '1' found above is reached, simply copy the values over from the array to the next spot in memory
            {
                if (binary_digits[i] == 0)
                {
                    *(pointer + i) = 0 + '0';
                }
                else
                {
                    *(pointer + i) = 1 + '0';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Add the null terminator to the end of the string
    *(pointer + count) = '\0';

    // return a pointer the the MSB in memory
    return pointer;
}
```

After converting the files to fixed point representation, the next task was implement the 25-tap FIR filter in VDHL, using the values in  ***lab3-in-fixed-point.txt*** as the inputs to the filter. The values from  ***lab3-coef-fixed-point.txt*** were not read from the file like the input value, but instead kept in array. We also used an array to store the 25 most recent input values. Next, all we had to do was implement the formula from earlier. Given an new input $x$, the entire input array gets shifted by one index and the new input gets inserted at the zero index. Each of the 25 most recent input values is then multiplied by the corresponding weight and the product is accumulated to the total output, $y$. Upon iterating through the entire array, $y$ is the filtered value of $x$. An important step is to reset y back to zero (line 59) after an input gets filtered (once per clock cycle), otherwise the output will get accumulated with the previous filtered values as well.

Running the simulation, it was verified that the 25-tap FIR filter functioned as expected, as seen in Fig. 2 below.

## Resource Utilization

### Compilation Report & Chip Planner

![creenshot (63](C:\Users\Lucas\Documents\Classes\Winter 2018\ECSE 325\Lab_Reports\Lab3\Screenshot (63).png)

*Fig. 3 Compilation Report: Flow Summary*

From the flow summary we can see that 401 registers are used in the implementation. The FIR filter is more resource-inefficient than the MAC unit and the bit counter implemented in the previous labs. As the order of the FIR filter increases, i.e. number of taps increases, more resources will be required to realize the design as arrays are used in the VHDL code to temporarily store the convolution from the taps. The Chip Planner below (*Fig. 4*) shows the used resources in dark blue. Much of the resources are still unused and therefore this design could have been implemented on a smaller chip.

Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 below take a closer look at the RTL view.

*Fig. 7 Zoomed in RTL View of the End of the Circuit*

Comparing the RTL view to the direct form of the FIR filter (Fig. 1) verifies that our VHDL design is indeed implementing the filter in the direct form of the filter. Registers, adders and multipliers are the only resources used to implement the filter.

# Conclusion

As stated in the introduction, the purpose of this lab was to learn how to implement digital filters using VHDL, and to verify the design by performing testbench simulations using ModelSim. More specifically, we implemented a 25-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and verified its behaviour by running a testbench simulation in ModelSim. Fortunately, we did not run into any problems during this lab and our FIR filter designed in VHDL output the expected filtered values.
